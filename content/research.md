# Change in gay neighborhoods

How do gayborhoods change in a time of rising social acceptance?

Gay neighborhoods are meaningful spaces for LGBTQ people, who worry that these spaces are assimilating and gentrifying as LGBTQ people integrate into US society. I show that evidence for widespread gayborhood change is actually quite limited. I webscrape a set of digital gay bar listings to identify gay neighborhoods across over 20 cities, then examine change in these places across several demographic and economic indicators using the American Community Survey.

# Digital trace data

When do people disclose their sexualities on social media? What can that tell us about sexuality in the US population?

In collaboration with Ridhi Kashyap, I use aggregate estimates from Facebook's advertising platform to investigate the disclosure and demography of sexuality on social media in the United States. We leverage variation by relationship status, age, and gender to see which factors influence the disclosure of LGB or straight sexual orientations. We validate these estimates against existing sources at coarse geographic levels, but show that these digital trace data carry the potential to go beyond existing estimates in their level of detail---while preserving the privacy of individual social media users.

# Other projects

I have also used agent-based modeling to simulate the impact of coming out on public opinion and used regularized regression models that incorporated scores based on surveys of variable importance for prediction in the Fragile Families Challenge.
