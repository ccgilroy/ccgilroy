<!-- # Connor Gilroy,<br> queer computational sociologist -->

I'm a PhD student in sociology at the University of Washington. I use digital and computational methods to study queer communities. By studying LGBTQ people and their interactions in society, I aim to understand processes of belonging, visibility, and social change.

[My projects](/research/) examine change in gay neighborhoods, disclosure of sexualities on social media, impacts of coming out on public opinion, and integration of qualitative and quantitative sources of knowledge. 

My name is pronounced [/ˈkɒnər ˈgɪlrɔɪ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English). I generally use [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) pronouns.
