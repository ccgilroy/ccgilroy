I've helped to develop and teach a new course in Data and Society for UW Sociology.

# Computational social science

I've taught and organized workshops and full courses in computational social science. 

With Emilio Zagheni, I facilitated the IUSSP workshop on Social Media and Demographic Research at IPC 2017 ([materials on GitHub](Social Media and Demographic Research)). In 2018, I organized the Seattle partner location for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science ([SICSS-Seattle](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/seattle/)). I have been a teaching assistant for two advanced courses, Data Science and Population Processes and [Bayesian Statistics for the Social Sciences](https://uw-csss-564.github.io/2018/). 

# Other courses

I have also been a teaching assistant for foundational courses such as Sociological Theory and substantive courses such as Intimate Relationships.
